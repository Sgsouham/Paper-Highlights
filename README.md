# Paper-Highlights
Highlighted and Annotated versions of papers I worked on .

# Why .xopp and not pdf?
I would want you(the reader) to add or remove your own highlights as and when required.

# How to View
- Download [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)
- File>Open filename.pdf.xopp

# Contribute
- Make a PR with your .xopp file and before this , an issue ticket would be greatly appreciated.
